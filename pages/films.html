        <h3>Films</h3>
        <p>
          Films are similar to novels or short stories in that they tell a
          story. They include the same genres: romantic, historical, detective,
          thriller, adventure, horror, and science fiction. However, films may
          also include sub-groups such as: action, comedy, tragedy, westerns and
          war. The methods you use to analyze a film are closely related to
          those used to analyze literature; nevertheless, films are multimedial.
          They are visual media made for viewers. Films take command of more of
          our senses to create special atmospheres, feelings or to bring out
          emotions.
        </p>
        <p class="quoted-text text-background right-text">
          Along with the literary elements such as plot, setting,
          characterization, structure, and theme, which make up the text or
          screenplay, there are many different film techniques used to tell the
          story or narrative. Attention is paid to sound, music, lighting,
          camera angles, and editing. What is important is to focus on how all
          the elements are used together in making a good film.

            A Trip to the Moon (French: Le Voyage dans la Lune)[a] is a 1902
            French adventure short film directed by Georges Méliès. Inspired by
            a wide variety of sources, including Jules Verne's 1865 novel From
            the Earth to the Moon and its 1870 sequel Around the Moon, the film
            follows a group of astronomers who travel to the Moon in a
            cannon-propelled capsule, explore the Moon's surface, escape from an
            underground group of Selenites (lunar inhabitants), and return to
            Earth with a captive Selenite. Its ensemble cast of French
            theatrical performers is led by Méliès himself as main character
            Professor Barbenfouillis. The film features the overtly theatrical
            style for which Méliès became famous.
