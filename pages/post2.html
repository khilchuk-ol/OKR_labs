              Whelp – it’s been an insane year – no doubt about it, but FINALLY
              there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and that light is the
              trailer to Denis Villeneuve’s version of the epic adventure film
              Dune, based on Frank Herbert’s cult masterpiece. Fans rejoice- the
              film is the first of an ambitious two part series.

              Regal was invited to an exclusive sit down interview with the cast
              of Dune, and as if that wasn’t cool enough- the event was hosted
              by Dune fanatic (!!!) Stephen Colbert. Obviously, we knew this
              would be an entertaining discussion with one of the greatest casts
              EVER assembled, but also relieved that the world premier of the
              Dune trailer was in the best possible hands.
