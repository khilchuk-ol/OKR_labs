          <h3>Cinemathography</h3>
          <p>
            Cinematography, the art and technology of motion-picture
            photography. It involves such techniques as the general composition
            of a scene; the lighting of the set or location; the choice of
            cameras, lenses, filters, and film stock; the camera angle and
            movements; and the integration of any special effects.

            Telling a story on film isn’t just about recording the action. It’s
            also about how the images are captured. In the film and television
            world, this is known as cinematography.
          </p>

          <h4>Why Is Cinematography Important to Filmmaking?</h4>
          <p>
            Cinematography sets and supports the overall look and mood of a
            film’s visual narrative. Each visual element that appears on screen,
            a.k.a. the mise-en-scène of a film, can serve and enhance the
            story—so it is the cinematographer’s responsibility to ensure that
            every element is cohesive and support the story. Filmmakers often
            choose to spend the majority of their budget on high-quality
            cinematography to guarantee that the film will look incredible on
            the big screen.
          </p>

          <h4>What Does a Cinematographer Do?</h4>
          <p>
            A cinematographer, also known as a
            <a href="directors.html#who-is-a-director">Director</a> of
            Photography, is in charge of the camera and the lighting crew.
            They’re the person responsible for creating the look, color,
            lighting, and for framing of every single shot in a film. The film’s
            director and cinematographer work closely together, as the main job
            of a cinematographer is to ensure that their choices support the
            director’s overall vision for the film. The cinematographer may also
            act as the camera operator on more low-budget productions.
            Cinematographers who work their way up in the film industry can join
            the American Society of Cinematographers, which gives awards for the
            best cinematography and allows members to put “ASC” after their name
            in credits.

          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>
            Creating a film is both an art and a science—referred to as
            cinematography. Since the first motion picture was created in 1888,
            cinematography has greatly evolved. What was once silent and black
            and white is now digital, full color, and enhanced with
            sophisticated visual effects and scores of music.
          </p>
          <p>
            To expand your cinematography background, you have to understand
            where cinematography started—and how it evolved into what it is now.

          <p>
            Cinematographers should think carefully about every shot,
            considering the angle, the light, and the camera movement, because
            there is an infinite number of choices they can make. Common
            cinematography techniques and terms include:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Close-up: a shot that closely crops in on a character’s face or on
              an object.
            </li>
            <li>Extreme close-up: A tightly framed close-up shot.</li>
            <li>
              Long shot: a shot showing a character in relation to their
              surroundings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extreme long shot: a shot so far away from the character, they are
              no longer visible within their surroundings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Establishing shot: a shot at the beginning of a scene that gives
              context for the setting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tracking shot: a sideways-moving shot that captures a landscape or
              that follows a character as they move. Often used interchangeably
              with “dolly shot,” though they technically refer to different
              motions.
            </li>
