        <h3>Genres</h3>
        <p>
          One of the few rare things that one can actually learn in film school
          is the simple trick of taking a step back to view something you
          already know — through a new, academic lens. As filmmakers and film
          fans, we already know about film genres. It wasn’t until one of the
          first film theory classes I took that I actually learned how to view,
          deconstruct, and understand something as seemingly innate as genre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding “genre theory” is both very simple and very complex. In
          general, we all know the basics. The Hobbit is a fantasy book. Star
          Trek is a sci-fi television show. When Harry Met Sally is a rom-com.
          So, what do all those genre names actually mean? And, what exactly are
          the writers, filmmakers, and storytellers really doing to work within
          and against these modes?
        </p>

        <h4>Basic film genres</h4>
        <p>
          In the early days of cinema, genres were much more uniform and
          defined. Just as they were in literature and other forms of art and
          entertainment, people would go to the theater to watch a war film, a
          musical, or a comedy. The basic genres were well defined and included
          some of the following:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><i>Action</i></dt>
          <dd>
            A film genre in which the protagonist or protagonists are thrust
            into a series of events that typically include violence, extended
            fighting, physical feats, rescues and frantic chases.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Comedy</i></dt>
          <dd>A genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor.</dd>
          <dt><i>Drama</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Drama Films are serious presentations or stories with settings or
            life situations that portray realistic characters in conflict with
            either themselves, others, or forces of nature
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Fantasy</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Films that base their content upon some degree of scientific truth,
            take the audience to netherworld, fairy-tale places where events are
            unlikely to occur in real life.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Horror</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Horror Films are unsettling films designed to frighten and panic,
            cause dread and alarm, and to invoke our hidden worst fears, often
            in a terrifying, shocking finale, while captivating and entertaining
            us at the same time in a cathartic experience.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Mystery</i></dt>
          <dd>
            A mystery film is a genre of film that revolves around the solution
            of a problem or a crime.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Romance</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Romance Films: Romance films are love stories, or affairs of the
            heart that center on passion, emotion, and the romantic,
            affectionate involvement of the main characters (usually a leading
            man and lady), and the journey that their love takes through
            courtship or marriage.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Thriller and Suspense</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Thriller and Suspense Films: These are types of films known to
            promote intense excitement, suspense, a high level of anticipation,
            ultra-heightened expectation, uncertainty, anxiety, and
            nerve-wracking tension.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Western</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Westerns are the major defining genre of the American film industry,
            a nostalgic eulogy to the early days of the expansive, untamed
            American frontier (the borderline between civilization and the
            wilderness).
