        <h3>Directors</h3>
        <p>
          Like a stage director, a movie director tells the actors how to play a
          particular scene, sets the scene for a specific type of mood, and
          moves the actors around for a particular effect. In the above
          definition, the word setting is referring to the specific atmosphere
          created by the props, location, scenery, and costumes.

            >cinematography includes both the camera shots and the lighting</a

          to obtain both a particular type of effect and mood. The director also
          has control over the editing to create the pace, rhythm, coherence,
          story, and character development they and the producer want.

        <h4>6 Duties and Responsibilities of a Cinematographer</h4>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <b>Chooses a visual style for the film.</b> A cinematographer
            determines the visual style and approach of the film. For example, a
            cinematographer on a documentary film determines whether to use
            re-enactments, or to rely heavily on photographs and found footage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Establishes the camera setup for every shot.</b> A
            cinematographer decides which types of cameras, camera lenses,
            camera angles, and camera techniques best bring the scene to life.
            Additionally, a cinematographer works with the script supervisor
            and, if necessary, the locations manager to scope out each scene and
            design what the most effective vantage points for the camera will
            be. This helps preserve the intention and scale of the film.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Determines the lighting for every scene.</b> A cinematographer
            uses lighting to create the right visual mood the director aspires
            to achieve. They must know how to enhance an image’s depth,
            contrast, and contour to support the story’s atmosphere.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Explores the potential of every location.</b> A good
            cinematographer understands what visuals excite the director and can
            make recommendations about what shots to capture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Attends rehearsals.</b> A cinematographer attends rehearsals with
            the actors since the blocking for a scene will likely change and
            evolve. During rehearsals, cinematographers adjust the camera in
            response to a particular gesture or action, and as actors adjust
            their body positions and blocking, to better fit the framing of the
            shot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Elevates the vision of the director.</b> A good cinematographer
            will introduce ideas and concepts the director may not have
            considered.
          </li>
